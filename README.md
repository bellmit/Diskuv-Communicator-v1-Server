Signal-Server
=================

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.
Diskuv Communicator is a fork of the Signal messaging app, customized for the needs of the Diskuv community.

Pronunciation: "Diskuv" sounds just like "discover", without the "er".

Goals
-----

We at Diskuv won't be perfect, but we strive for:

- Safety. Let Diskuv survivors have safe communities comprised of other survivors and vetted counseling and advocacy staff
- Trust. Give Diskuv survivors a high level of assurance that Diskuv does not have access to the communities' conversations beyond what its members explicitly give it
- Kindness. Diskuv survivors should find communicating easy, friendly to use and above all helpful as they manage their lives

Anti Goals
----------

- Anonymity. Instead, Diskuv survivors should have a high degree of confidence that they are talking to a) other survivors in general, and/or b) other survivors specifically from their counseling or advocacy groups
