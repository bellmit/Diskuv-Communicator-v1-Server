Diskuv-Communicator-Server
==========================

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.
Diskuv Communicator is a fork of the Signal messaging app, customized for the needs of the Diskuv community.

Pronunciation: "Diskuv" sounds just like "discover", without the "er".

Goals
-----

Diskuv won't be perfect, but we strive for:

- Safety. Have safe communities comprised of other peers (ex. other family members, other support group members, etc.)
- Trust. A high level of assurance that Diskuv does not have access to the communities' conversations beyond what its members explicitly give it
- Kindness. Communicating should be easy, friendly to use and above all helpful as members' manage their lives

Anti Goals
----------

- Anonymity. Instead, members should have a high degree of confidence that they know the _affiliation_ of the person they are talking to. That is, members should know they are talking to people who share the same family/job/counselor etc.
